# Car Driving
 
The first project as part of the Junior Programmer pathway on Unity Learn. A major focus of this project and a lot of the upcoming ones is the use of scripts to enable various forms of player control in a game (such as switching between camera views, allowing user input to move vehicles, etc). These are indeed the very fundamentals of programming.
